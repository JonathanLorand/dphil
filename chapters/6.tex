\chapter{Further directions}

Open systems. 

\section{Open Markov processes}
Bring in notions of entropy, summary statistics. 
\section{Flow networks}
cf linear algebra. diagrams+rewrite rules, algebraic semantics, summary arrays.



\section{Chemical reaction networks}

\section{Bounded colimits}


Grothendieck construction
\section{Other categorical structures}
Not all diagrammatic structures have the same hypergraph network style. For
example, some have substantive notions of input and output. Spivak's work on
operads of wiring diagrams
