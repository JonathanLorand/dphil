\chapter{Further directions}

Open systems. 

\section{Theoretical}
\subsection{Bounded colimits}
Why are epis so important? Extended theory

Grothendieck construction (Kissinger comment)

\subsection{Classifying hypergraph categories}


\subsection{Other categorical structures}
Not all diagrammatic structures have the same hypergraph network style. For
example, some have substantive notions of input and output. Spivak's work on
operads of wiring diagrams 


\section{Applied}
\subsection{Passive linear networks}
  Inverse problems eg UCLA student 

\subsection{Open Markov processes}
Bring in notions of entropy, summary statistics. 

\subsection{Flow networks}
cf linear algebra. diagrams+rewrite rules, algebraic semantics, summary arrays.



\subsection{Chemical reaction networks}
