Decorated cospans: 
We shall assume the following standard names for certain distinguished objects
and morphisms, only disambiguating the symbols with subscripts when we judge
that the extra clarity is worth the clutter. We write: 
\begin{itemize} 
  \item $1$ for both identity morphisms and monoidal units, leaving context to
    determine which one we mean.
  \item $\lambda$, $\rho$, $a$, and $\sigma$ for respectively the left unitor, right unitor,
    associator, and, if present, braiding, in a monoidal category.
  \item $\varnothing$ for the initial object in a category.
  \item $!$ for the unique map from the initial object to a given object.
  \item Given a category $\mc C$, write $\mc C^\opp$ for the opposite category.
    Given a morphism $f\maps A \to B \in \mc C$, write $f^\opp\maps B \to A \in
    \mc C^\opp$ for the corresponding morphism in the opposite category.
\end{itemize}

If a monoidal structure on $\Set$ is not specified, we assume it is the
cartesian product. 

If a monoidal structure on $\FinSet$ is not specified, we assume it is the
disjoint union.
